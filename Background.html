                Hi there! I'm Sahil, a Data Scientist and Lecturer based in Durban, South Africa. This page offers a
                glimpse
                into my personal and professional journey, highlighting the experiences that have shaped who I am today.
                <br>
                <br>
                I grew up in Verulam, then Howick, before my family settled in Scottburgh on the KwaZulu Natal
                southcoast.
                After graduating from Scottburgh High School, I pursued a degree in Physics at the University of KwaZulu
                Natal, which provided a solid foundation for my career in both research and lecturing.
                <br>
                <br>
                After achieving my Honours, Masters and Doctorate in geophysical data analysis studying seismic
                activity,
                <br>I started my career at UKZN, where I learned the fundamentals of teaching tertiary level Physics.
                <br>Upon receiving my PhD I worked at the South African National Space Agency, as a Postdoctoral
                Research
                Fellow, focusing on forecast model development and validation of in-house forecasting models.
                <br>Today, I lecture at UKZN in both the Physics and Engineering departments, focusing on Classical
                Mechanics, Electromagnetism and Nuclear & Particle Physics.

                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond my professional life, I'm an avid amateur artist, footballer, gymer, and music enthusiast. I'm
                passionate about learning new languages and software, as my interest in using computers was first
                sparked
                with editing videos (primarily from youtube videos of DragonballZ set to Linkin Park).

                <br>
                <br>
                I value responsibility and integrity,which has influenced both my professional and personal
                interactions.
                <br>A quote I live by is "With great power, comes great responsibility", a familiar line but one I have
                found has guided my actions.

                <br>
                <br>
                Looking ahead, I aim to establish myself as a senior lecturer and advance my research career in using
                geophysical data analytics to forecast large scale seismic activity, hence aiding in disaster
                mitigation.
                <br>I am also interested in starting my own business (Just waiting for that 3am spark of genius). <br>
