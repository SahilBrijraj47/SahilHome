                Welcome to My Research Profile
                <br><br>
                I’m excited to share my academic journey and research interests with you.
                <br><br>

                I graduated from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, where I completed my BSc in 2009, majoring
                in Pure and Applied Physics. In 2010, I earned my Honours degree in Theoretical Physics, during which I
                had the opportunity to study Coronal Mass Ejections under the guidance of Prof. John Rash and analyze
                lightning whistlers with Dr. Andrew Collier from SANSA. My academic pursuits continued, and in 2013, I
                obtained my Master’s degree in Space Science, focusing on potential f0F2 ionospheric precursory
                anomalies concerning major seismic activities. Finally, in 2020, I achieved my PhD by developing an
                algorithm designed to estimate the location and underlying mechanisms of microseismic events within a
                working mine.
                <br><br>

                My primary research interests lie in Earth and Space sciences, encompassing seismic and volcanic events,
                as well as coronal mass ejections and solar flares. Over the years, I have concentrated on Geophysical
                Data Analysis, particularly focusing on ionospheric and seismic data.
                <br><br>

                A passion project of mine—and an area I intend to explore further—is analyzing ionospheric anomalies as
                potential precursors to seismic activity. My ultimate goal is to study and formalize these
                relationships, thereby contributing to the forecasting of catastrophic disasters and enhancing hazard
                mitigation efforts.
                <br><br>

                Thank you for taking the time to learn about my research journey! I look forward to connecting with
                others who share similar interests and exploring the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in Earth and
                Space sciences.
            </p>
